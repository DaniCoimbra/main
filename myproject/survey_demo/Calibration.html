        <p>
            A robo-investor has been calibrated to make monthly investment choices on your behalf. 
            The calibration was based on your choice of investment in the lottery on the previous screen. 
        </p>

        <h3>Scenario:</h3>

        <p>
            Every month you allocate $100 for your robo-investor to distribute between a risk-free savings account and a stock market index.
        </p>

        <p>
            The robot is perfectly informed about the interest rate on the savings account and about the distribution of possible returns on the stock market index. 
            Both the interest rate and the distribution of stock market index returns may change from month to month. 
        </p>

            <p>Thank you for participating in this session. It should take at most <strong>30 minutes</strong> to complete, with <strong>5 minutes</strong> allocated for this screen alone. Please, read it carefully.</p>

            <p>
                During this session, you will be asked to make a choice that will help us understand your attitude towards risk. The choice is a hypothetical investment of up to $100 in a lottery that has equal chances of increasing your investment by 30% or decreasing it by 10%. Any amount that is not invested in the lottery remains unchanged. Your choice will be used to calibrate a robo-investor, which will manage your investments for the duration of the session.
            </p>

                <p>
                    The session is conducted as a series of investment rounds. Each round represents a month of investment, and there are eight blocks of two investment rounds. After each block, you'll have an opportunity to adjust your choice of hypothetical investment in the above lottery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the <strong>start</strong> of every investment round <strong>you will be given 100 token-dollars</strong> that the robo-investor will invest on your behalf. After each block of four investment rounds, you will be given the outcome of the investment, both cumulative and per round as well as an opportunity to change your hypothetical investment and thus re-calibrate the robo-advisor.
