        <p>Thank you for participating in this session. It should take approximately <strong>X minutes</strong> to complete.</p>

        <p>
            During this session, you will be asked to make a choice that will help us understand your attitude towards risk. This choice will calibrate a robo-investor, which will manage your investments for the duration of the session.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can revisit and adjust your choice every four investment rounds. Each round represents a month of investment, and there are four sections of four investment rounds. After each section, you'll have an opportunity to adjust your choice.
        </p>

        <p>
            For your participation, you will receive <strong>$X</strong>, which is independent of your responses. Additionally, a bonus payment will be determined by a random draw of one of the four investment sections, and you will be paid 5% of your investment performance for that section.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;">
            <strong>Good luck, and thank you for your participation!</strong>
