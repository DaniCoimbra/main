    <p>1. Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2% per year. After 5 years, how much do you think you would have in the account if you left the money to grow?</p>

    <form method="post">
        <div class="risk-question">
            <div class="question">
                <div class="radios-container">
                    {{ form.q5 }}
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>


    <p>2. Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1% per year and inflation was 2% per year. After 1 year, would you be able to buy:</p>

        <div class="risk-question">
            <div class="question">
                <div class="radios-container">
                    {{ form.q6 }}
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </form>

    <p>3. Do you think that the following statement is true or false? "Buying a single company stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund."</p>

        <div class="risk-question">
            <div class="question">
                <div class="radios-container">
                    {{ form.q7 }}
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </form>
    {{ next_button }}
